# Enhancing Species Distribution Modeling through Advanced Loss Functions

## Abstract
This study investigates the application of advanced loss functions in species distribution modeling (SDM) to improve the true positive rate (TPR) while maintaining model accuracy. We implement and compare three specialized loss functions (Tversky, Focal, and Dice) alongside traditional approaches using both Random Forest and Weighted Logistic Regression models.

## 1. Introduction

Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) plays a crucial role in ecological research and conservation planning. Traditional SDM approaches often focus on overall accuracy, potentially overlooking the importance of correctly identifying species presence (true positives). This study addresses this limitation by implementing advanced loss functions specifically designed to optimize the true positive rate.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Preparation
- Presence and absence data from Dalbergia species in India
- Environmental variables including temperature, precipitation, and soil characteristics
- Bias correction weights based on ecoregion distribution
- Reliability weights for absence data

### 2.2 Model Architecture

We implemented and compared eight different modeling approaches:

1. **Baseline Models**
   - Random Forest (RF)
   - Weighted Logistic Regression (WLR)

2. **Advanced Loss Functions**
   - Tversky Loss (α=0.3, β=0.7)
   - Focal Loss (α=0.25, γ=2.0)
   - Dice Loss (smooth=1.0)

Each loss function was implemented for both RF and WLR models.

### 2.3 Loss Function Details

#### Tversky Loss
\[
L_{tversky} = 1 - \frac{TP}{TP + \alpha FP + \beta FN}
\]

#### Focal Loss
\[
L_{focal} = -\alpha_t(1-p_t)^\gamma \log(p_t)
\]

#### Dice Loss
\[
L_{dice} = 1 - \frac{2TP + smooth}{2TP + FP + FN + smooth}
\]

| WLR        | Dice          | 0.7412   | 0.7143 | 0.73     |

### 3.2 Key Findings

1. **Best Overall Performance**: Random Forest with Tversky Loss
   - Highest TPR (0.8095)
   - Maintained good accuracy (0.8235)
   - Balanced precision and recall

2. **Model Type Comparison**
   - Random Forest consistently outperformed Logistic Regression
   - Weighted Logistic Regression showed more stable performance across different loss functions

3. **Loss Function Impact**
   - Tversky Loss showed the best improvement in TPR
   - Focal Loss provided good balance between TPR and accuracy
   - Dice Loss showed moderate improvement but with some accuracy trade-off

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Advantages of Advanced Loss Functions

1. **Improved True Positive Rate**
   - All advanced loss functions showed improvement in TPR compared to baseline models
   - Tversky Loss provided the most significant improvement

2. **Balanced Performance**
   - Maintained reasonable accuracy while improving TPR
   - Better handling of class imbalance

### 4.2 Practical Implications

1. **Conservation Planning**
   - Higher TPR means better identification of potential species habitats
   - Reduced risk of missing important presence locations

2. **Model Selection**
   - Random Forest with Tversky Loss recommended for optimal performance
   - Weighted Logistic Regression suitable when interpretability is important

## 5. Conclusion

The implementation of advanced loss functions in SDM has shown promising results in improving the true positive rate while maintaining model accuracy. The Tversky Loss function, in particular, demonstrated the best performance when combined with Random Forest. These improvements can significantly enhance the reliability of species distribution predictions for conservation planning and ecological research.
